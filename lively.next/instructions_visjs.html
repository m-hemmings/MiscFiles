    <b>Instructions for VisJS Morph</b>
</div>
<div class="bodyText">
    <p>This is a category visualization template ready for editing with any data you need to create a compelling and manipulatable data set.
    <p>This visualization contains the following: 
        To add data to the visualization, there is a method on the canvas morph called getData and it contains a few sample nodes and edges.  This is where your source data can be added if you want it visible on load.  As of this version, there is no persistent stored data.  This will be updated soon, but for now, I suggest an external data source.
    </p>
    <p>The following listeners exist for this <A HREF="http://visjs.org/">vis.js</A> morph:
    <table id ="listeners" style="table-layout: fixed; width: auto">

  <tr>
    <th>Listener Name</th>
    <th>Function</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Single Click</td>
    <td>Currently not assigned to a function, previously used to center graph on a clicked node</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Double Click</td>
    <td>
    If used on a node that is a cluster container of other nodes, it will expand/collapse.  Note that a node with no other members of the same group will not collapse.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Long Click</td>
    <td>
        <ul>
        <li>If used on a node, it will create a copy with no attached edges and append a "_1" to both the name and node id</li>
        <li>If used on empty space, this will create a node that has no values in it with a unique name and node id</li>
        </ul>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Hover</td>
    <td>Currently displays tooltip mounted in upper left corner.  Setup for tooltip can be found in setTTStyle method on the html canvas morph</td>

    <td>Currently set to remove the last active tooltip</td>

        <b>Morphic Interactions</b>    
    </div>
    <div class="bodyText">
    <p>
        There are 3 buttons on the bottom of the window, 2 for edge interactions and one for help.
    </p>
    <p>
    <h3>Add Edges</h3>
        To add an edge, click the "Add Edge" button.  This will enter edit mode, where you can click on a source node and drag the edge to the target.  In the event that you attempt to draw an edge to a cluster, it will fail but provide a popup indicating that the error has occurred.  In addition, a cancel button appears in the upper right corner, presenting an option to exit without creating an edge, should you so desire.<BR>
    <h3>Edit Edges</h3>
        When you click the "Edit Edge" button, you must first have an edge selected.  Doing so will then open the control points for the edge, either of which can be dragged to a new node.  Again, dragging the edge to a cluster will fail with an alert and you are able to cancel the edit behavior in the same sense that you can cancel an add operation above.
