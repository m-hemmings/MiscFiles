    <b>Instructions for NBA Visualization</b>
</div>
<div class="bodyText">
    <p>The intent of this project is to show how it is possible to easily create a meaningful visualization using the <A HREF="http://visjs.org/">vis.js</A> library.
    <p>This visualization contains the following: 
    <ul>
        <li>One node for each player (contains their statistics in various properties)</li>
        <li>One node for each team, divided by Western and Eastern Conference</li>
        <li>One node for each conference, attached to the league node</li>
        <li>One node for the league</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>The following listeners exist for this <A HREF="http://visjs.org/">vis.js</A> morph:
    <table id ="listeners" style="table-layout: fixed; width: auto">

  <tr>
    <th>Listener Name</th>
    <th>Function</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Single Click</td>
    <td>Currently not assigned to a function, previously used to center graph on a clicked node</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Double Click</td>
    <td><ul>
    <li>If used on a node that is a cluster container of other nodes, it will expand/collapse</</li>
    <li>If used on a player node, it will open an editor in which the various values can be edited by the user</li>
    </ul>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Long Click</td>
    <td>
        <ul>
        <li>If used on a node, it will create a copy with no attached edges and append a "_1" to both the name and node id</li>
        <li>If used on empty space, this will create a node that has no values in it with a unique name and node id</li>
        </ul>

    <td>Currently displays tooltip mounted in upper left corner.  Setup for tooltip can be found in setTTStyle method on the html canvas morph</td>

        <b>Morphic Interactions</b>    
    </div>
    <div class="bodyText">
    <p>
        There are 3 buttons on the bottom of the window, 2 for edge interactions and one for help.
    </p>
    <p>
    <h3>Add Edges</h3>
        To add an edge, click the "Add Edge" button.  This will enter edit mode, where you can click on a source node and drag the edge to the target.  In the event that you attempt to draw an edge to a cluster, it will fail but provide a popup indicating that the error has occurred.  In addition, a cancel button appears in the upper right corner, presenting an option to exit without creating an edge, should you so desire.<BR>
    <h3>Edit Edges</h3>
        When you click the "Edit Edge" button, you must first have an edge selected.  Doing so will then open the control points for the edge, either of which can be dragged to a new node.  Again, dragging the edge to a cluster will fail with an alert and you are able to cancel the edit behavior in the same sense that you can cancel an add operation above.
